## Project Summary
An approach to identify what factors contribute to clients’ default rate and evaluation on lending risk to a specific client by using past data is described in this paper. We use feature engineering to extract and select useful features in order to determine the ability of clients to repay the loan on time. Through the investigation of some trending classification algorithms and the help of the ensemble learning, we hope to improve the performance of our final model. The result shows that our best model is LightGBM with combined data and upsampling method. To go beyond the current model performance, we need more information about clients and more estimators in the LightGBM model to identify clients’ default risk.
